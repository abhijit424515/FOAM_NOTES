## Typography
- For capital letter text effects, try to go for blend effects with contrasting colors.
- Some 3D effects using an offset-duplicate and vibrant color choice can create an interesting neon effect.
- For centered content, we can choose a subtle radial gradient for the background.
- Try some funky text smudge/frost effects maybe.

- Don't need to overforce negative space in design.
