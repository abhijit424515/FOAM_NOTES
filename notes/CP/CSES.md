## Introductory Problems
1. Weird Algorithm

Although nobody ws able to prove the Collatz conjecture, the code execution for this problem is fairly straightforward.

However, when using large inputs, we may have int overflow. This may likely cause a non-terminating loop, and even if the loop terminates, the answer will be wrong. So we need to use `long long int` data type.
