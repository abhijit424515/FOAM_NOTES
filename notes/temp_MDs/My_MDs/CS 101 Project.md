# Bubble Trouble
## Introduction

In this project you will use C++ to create a game, Bubble Trouble. Your aim is to clear all the bubbles. Destroy the bouncing bubbles by splitting them using bullets, but don’t let them touch you! Are you up for the challenge?

To help you get started, we have provided a starter code which implements basic functionality of the game. Your task is to complete the game by implementing all the required features and further enhance it by implementing at least 2 extra features.

A screen recording of the functionality provided in the starter code, required features and extra features can be found at [this link](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kDKONIZFMCGAQDXFlkHTXkvsipljLYTF?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1643309509177917&usg=AOvVaw3IU5ssDo5oPiiA5DgKaMRc).

## Additional Concepts used in the Project
[Lecture Videos for these concepts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QkUm44keZsIttIhQDtHImWfbC_jRHjd8)
### Header files (.h)

As programs grow larger, it becomes increasingly tedious to write all the code in a single .cpp file. So we split our program into multiple files. In the project, we split different classes into separate files called header files which usually have a .h extension, and use a single main.cpp file.

We include the contents of the header files in the main.cpp file using the command ```#include "header.h"```
Similarly, the command ```#include <simplecpp>``` also includes the content of the simplecpp library header files into your .cpp file.

Later in your programming life you will learn about code split into multiple cpp and h files that will have to be compiled separately and linked together to form a larger program. But for now we can use this simple include mechanism to split code into multiple code and still compile only once.

### vector
A collection of data of similar types, for example a list of integers or a list of names can be stored into an array. We will learn about arrays in the course. However, arrays that we will learn about have a fixed number of elements. Sometimes you may want to store multiple elements of a type but do not know how many such elements you will have to store before the program runs. In such a case, memory has to be allocated for such dynamically growing lists or collections during the time when the program is running. We can extend arrays with dynamic memory allocation.

However, there is a neat solution to this problem using a container data type in C++ (i.e., it can contain elements of other data types).

In the project starter code, to store multiple elements of a particular data type, we use the vector container data type. To create a vector of data type int, we can use the following command

```vector<int> v;```

To add elements in the vector v, we can use the push_back command. For example to add 3, 1 and 5 in the vector v, we can use the following commands
```
v.push_back(3);  // v contains 3
v.push_back(1);  // v contains 3, 1
v.push_back(5);  // v contains 3, 1, 5

You can access the elements in the vector using the index. For example to access the 2nd element of the vector, we can use the following command
v[1];  // indexing starts from 0, so 1 is the 2nd element

To delete an element in the vector, we can use the erase command. To delete the 3rd element (index 2) in the vector, we can use the following command
v.erase(v.begin()+2);        // v.begin() points to the first element in the vector
```

### string

A string is a collection of sequential characters. C++ has a string data type which can be used as follows
```string text = "Hello World";  // string literals are placed between double quotes```

More information about string can be found at this [link](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1644119516914588&usg=AOvVaw3yIPH3jqTMgiMPHSU-ooQf).

### XEvent

In simplecpp graphics, we have seen the getClick() command that captures a mouse click. In the project, we capture keyboard presses to play the game. The mouse click and a keyboard press are examples of events. To capture such events we use the XEvent command. The starter code is already completely set up to use XEvent for capturing keyboard events, so you need not write any additional code. To know more about event based programming, you can refer to this [link](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f4Is5PE-7RSfPtYW2Hn1Xemg9BEKQv7u/view?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1644119516915284&usg=AOvVaw3xB0vv36EN_jHmhsiE_Gro).
## Starter code

The starter code can be found at [this link](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vMY0LrRnwn5doVO-2EFu6l4rTukSLXSN/view?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1643309509179404&usg=AOvVaw0RSOC3ZRmjhthVop_lFypm).

You can compile the starter code using
``````
s++ main.cpp
``````
and run the program using
``````
./a.out
``````
Specifically, the starter code consists of the following files.

#### bubble.h
This file implements the class Bubble, which uses Circle from simplecpp graphics to represent the bubble in the game. The position of the bubble updates at every time step based on its velocity. We manually initialize the position and velocity of multiple bubbles. The bubble bounces against the two vertical borders of the window.

#### bullet.h
This file implements the class Bullet, which uses Rectangle from simplecpp graphics to represent the bullet in the game. The position of the bullet updates at every time step based on its velocity.

#### shooter.h
This file implements the class Shooter, which uses shapes from simplecpp graphics to represent the shooter in the game. In this case, we use a circle and a rectangle to represent the head and body of the shooter. Based on user input, the shooter can move left/right and also shoot bullets.

#### main.cpp
This file consists of the game simulation loop implemented using events. We use the following keys for user interaction

-   a: move shooter left
-   d: move shooter right
-   w: shoot 1 bullet
-   q: quit

The main function keeps track of the bullets and bubbles in the game using a vector.

### Functionality in starter code

The starter code provides functionality to
-   Create a window with a shooter and some bullets
-   Horizontally moving bubbles bouncing against the vertical walls
-   Ability to shoot a bullet from shooter vertically upwards

## Project Task

The project will be considered successful only if you

-   complete the basic version of the game by implementing the required features, and
-   enhance the game experience by implementing at least 2 extra features

You have to ensure that the game runs at interactive frame rate, i.e. there is no visible delay between the user's input and the movement of the graphical elements.

### Required Features
The following features are necessary to complete the basic version of the game.
-   Modify the bubble movement to incorporate vertical motion such that the bubbles travel in a parabolic path. When the ball hits the horizontal ground, it should bounce off the ground.
-   Introduce collision between the bubble and the bullet; the bubble disappears after a bullet hits it. After a collision, you can make the bullet disappear too.
-   Introduce collision between the bubble and the shooter; the shooter is dead if a bubble touches it.

### Extra Features
You are supposed to enhance the game experience by implementing at least 2 extra features from the following
-   Use bubbles of different sizes. When a bullet hits the larger bubbles, they should split into smaller bubbles (half the radius of the original larger bubble) and move in horizontally opposite directions.
-   Add a score, time and a health counter. The score increases whenever you hit a bubble. The game gets over when we run out of time (measured in seconds) or if we run out of health (whenever the bubble hits the shooter, the health reduces by 1).
-   You can implement different levels of the game. Once you destroy all the bubbles in one level, you can move to the next level which can be difficult in terms of more bubbles, faster moving bubbles, less time and/or more obstacles for bouncing. The bubbles in different levels must have different colors.

-   The code will be subject to plagiarism checking.
-   The project will be graded by taking individual vivas.
-   The deadline for submitting the project is 10:30pm Sunday, Feb 27 2022. Vivas will be held during the week from Feb 28 2022 to March 5 2022.
-   The project has two grades: pass / nopass
-   The project will be graded as pass based on the following
	-   program runs successfully demonstrating all the required features and at least 2 extra features, and
	-   code follows good programming practice (explanatory variable names, indentation, comments)
	-   you should be able to explain all aspects of your code during the viva

-   The only way to obtain AA grade in the course is
	-   get AB in normal evaluation, and
	-   get a pass in the project

-   A nopass in the project means no change in grade obtained otherwise.
-   The project cannot be used for any other kind of grade change (e.g., you cannot use the project to upgrade a BB to AB and so on), nor can it be used in lieu of any other evaluation.
-   Instructor’s decision about the project grade will be final.
