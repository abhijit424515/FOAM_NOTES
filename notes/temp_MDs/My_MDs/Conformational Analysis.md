# Conformational Analysis
Conformational Analysis is the study of energetics of different conformers.

| Terms          | Usage           |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Bond length    | between 2 atoms |
| Bond angle     | between 3 atoms |
| dihedral angle | between 4 atoms | 

* Conformational changes are vital to biological â€˜events'

#### Important Types of Molecular STRAINS
1. **Torsional Strain**: Extra energy of eclipsed conformation arising due to the repulsion between bonding electrons of one substituent with that of the other as they pass close to each other 
2. **Steric Strain**: Strain induced when two atoms or groups in a molecule are too close to each other, arising due to repulsion between electron clouds of interacting atoms/groups
3. **Angle Strain**: Strain induced in molecules when the bond angles are different from the desired tetrahedral bond angle of 109.5

**Example-1 -> Ethane**

<span class="yellow">[PAPER](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11952735_Hyperconjugation_not_steric_repulsion_leads_to_the_staggered_structure_of_ethane) : Hyperconjugation, not steric repulsion, leads to the staggered structure of ethane</span>

The Eclipsed conformer is 3.0 kcal/mol higher in energy than the staggered conformer. 

Higher energy of the eclipsed conformer is due to =>
(1) Bond pair-bond pair repulsion between C-H bonds

(2) Improved delocalization in the staggered conformer

**Example-4 -> Cyclobutane**

If the ring is planar ==> Angle strain and Torsional strain
Compromise => Ring puckering (relieves Torsional strain, with only a slight increase in Angle strain)

![[Pasted image 20220107102828.png|400]]
Here, cyclobutane has a 'wing shaped' or 'puckered' conformer

---
**Example-5 -> Cyclopentane**
If the ring is planar ==> negligible angle strain, while significant torsional strain
Compromise ==> Ring puckering (relieves Torsional strain, with only a slight increase in Angle strain)

![[Pasted image 20220107103145.png|400]]
Here, cyclopentane has an 'envelope' conformer
