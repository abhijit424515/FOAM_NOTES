In the highlighted IP address, there are **8x4 = 32 bits = 4 bytes** used

Why 8 bits for each section ? 
Take 192.
192 = 128x1 + 64x1 + 32x0 + 16x0 + 8x0 + 4x0 + 2x0 + 1x0
So, 192 is stored as 11000000, which constitute 8 bits.

==IPV4== : 32 bits are alloted in IPV4, which means (2^32) IP addresses are possible using IPV4 

==IPV6== : 128 bits are alloted in IPV6, which means (2^128) IP addresses are possible using IPV6

Even though IPV4 addresses should have already been exhausted, we still use them without worries.
This is because of ___Network Address Translation___
