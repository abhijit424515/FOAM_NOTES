# Basics
A **vertex** is a point coordinate represented as a 4-dimensional vector

Vertices are assembled into these **primitives**: 
- points
- lines
- triangles

---
Primitives are sent to the rasterizer, which generates **fragments**, which are pixels combined with other info like:
- location
- color
- normal
- depth
- opacity, etc.
